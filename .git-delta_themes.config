# source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandavison/delta/master/themes.gitconfig
# To use these themes, first include this file in your own gitconfig file:
#
# [include]
#     path = PATH/TO/delta/themes.gitconfig
#
# Then, in your own gitconfig file, activate the chosen theme, e.g.
#
# [delta]
#    features = kingfisher
#
# Please add your own themes to this file, and open a PR.
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1. The name of the theme must be the name of some sort of wild organism:
#    mammal, bird, plant, mollusk -- whatever. It can be in any language.
#
# 2. Use `delta --show-config` to list all the style settings that are active in
#    your current delta environment, but only include settings in your theme
#    that are essential to its appearance.
#
# 3. Include either `dark = true` or `light = true` according to whether it is
#    designed for a light or dark terminal background. (This marks a feature as
#    a "theme", causing it to be picked up by `delta --show-themes`).
#
# 4. Feel free to include a comment line indicating who is the author of the
#    theme. E.g. a link to your github user page.
