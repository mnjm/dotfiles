-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VeryLazy'
--
-- which loads which-key after all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (:help autocomd-events).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end

return {
  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
    'folke/which-key.nvim',
    event = #vim.fn.argv() > 0 and "VeryLazy" or "UIEnter",
    config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
      require('which-key').setup()

      -- Document existing key chains
      require('which-key').add {
        {'<leader>c', group = '[C]ode' },
        {'<leader>d', group = '[D]ocument/[D]iff' },
        {'<leader>r', group = '[R]ename' },
        {'<leader>s', group = '[S]earch' },
        {'<leader>w', group = '[W]orkspace' },
        {'<leader>f', group = '[F]ind' },
        {'<leader>t', group = '[T]oggle' },
        {'<leader>', group = 'VISUAL <leader>', mode = 'v' },
      }
    end,
